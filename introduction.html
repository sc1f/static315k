The collision of cultures that took place in 1492 has consequences that are still unfolding today. New foods reshaped the diets of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Sugar, coffee, cattle, pigs, and sheep reached the Americas, while corn, tobacco, tomatoes, and potatoes came to Africa, Asia, and Europe. The New World environment was transformed as Europeans cleared vast tracts of forested land and introduced cattle, goats, horses, sheep, and swine as well as Old World grasses and weeds. The European discovery of the New World also resulted in the sharpest population decline in human history, as millions of Indians died from smallpox, measles, and other epidemic diseases. With the New World population decimated by disease, Europeans gradually introduced a new labor force: enslaved Africans. By the late eighteenth century, Europeans were debating whether Columbus's discovery of the New World had added to or subtracted from human happiness.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">Three Worlds Collide</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">Many of Hollywood’s most popular films deal with encounters with aliens. Think Avatar, Star Wars, E.T., and Independence Day. In this module, we will examine a real life encounter between among aliens who never imagined the other’s existence.</p><p class="content-inject">This is a story far more interesting than anything Hollywood could imagine. It is also a story of death and destruction on a scale beyond even Hollywood’s imaginings.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">The Significance of 1492</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">The four hundredth anniversary of Christopher Columbus's "discovery" of the New World was commemorated with a massive "Columbian Exhibition" in Chicago in 1893. The exhibition celebrated Columbus as a man of mythic stature, an explorer and discoverer who carried Christian civilization across the Atlantic Ocean and initiated the modern age.</p><p class="content-inject">The five hundredth anniversary of Columbus's first voyage of discovery was treated quite differently. Many peoples of indigenous and African descent identified Columbus with imperialism, colonialism, and conquest. The National Council of Churches adopted a resolution calling October 12th a day of mourning for millions of indigenous people who died as a result of European colonization.</p><p class="content-inject">More than five hundred years after the first Spaniards arrived in the Caribbean, historians and the general public still debate Columbus's legacy. Should he be remembered as a great discoverer who brought European culture to a previously unknown world? Or should he be condemned as a man responsible for an "American Holocaust," a man who brought devastating European and Asian diseases to unprotected native peoples, disrupted the American ecosystem, and initiated the Atlantic slave trade? What is Columbus's legacy--discovery and progress, or slavery, disease, and racial antagonism?</p><p class="content-inject">To confront such questions, one must first recognize that the encounter that began in 1492 among the peoples of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres was one of the truly epochal events in world history. This cultural collision not only produced an extraordinary transformation of the natural environment and human cultures in the New World, it also initiated far-reaching changes in the Old World as well.</p><p class="content-inject">New foods reshaped the diets of people in both hemispheres. Tomatoes, chocolate, potatoes, corn, green beans, peanuts, vanilla, pineapple, and turkey transformed the European diet, while Europeans introduced sugar, cattle, pigs, cloves, ginger, cardamon, and almonds to the Americas. Global patterns of trade were overturned, as crops grown in the New World---including tobacco, rice, and vastly expanded production of sugar--fed growing consumer markets in Europe.</p><p class="content-inject">Even the natural environment was transformed. Europeans cleared vast tracks of forested land and inadvertently introduced Old World weeds. The introduction of cattle, goats, horses, sheep, and swine also transformed the ecology as grazing animals ate up many native plants and disrupted indigenous systems of agriculture. The horse, extinct in the New World for 10,000 years, transformed the daily existence of many indigenous peoples. The introduction of the horse encouraged many farming peoples to become hunters and herders. Hunters mounted on horses were also much more adept at killing game.</p><p class="content-inject">Death and disease--these too were consequences of contact. Diseases against which Indian peoples had no natural immunities caused the greatest mass deaths in human history. Within a century of contact, smallpox, measles, mumps, and whooping cough had reduced indigenous populations by 50 to 90 percent. From Peru to Canada, disease reduced the resistance that Native Americans were able to offer to European intruders.</p><p class="content-inject">With the Indian population decimated by disease, Europeans gradually introduces a new labor force into the New World: enslaved Africans. Between 1502 and 1870, when the Atlantic slave trade was finally suppressed, from ten to fifteen million Africans were shipped to the Americas.</p><p class="content-inject">Columbus's voyage of discovery also had another important result: it contributed to the development of the modern concept of progress. To many Europeans, the New World seemed to be a place of innocence, freedom, and eternal youth. The perception of the New World as an environment free from the corruptions and injustices of European life would provide a vantage point for criticizing all social evils. So while the collision of three worlds resulted in death and enslavement in unprecedented numbers, it also encouraged visions of a more perfect future.</p><p class="content-inject">Columbus's voyages represent one of the major discontinuities in human history. His voyages truly represented a historical watershed, with vast repercussions for all aspects of life in both the Old World and the New. The year 1492 - perhaps more than any other year in modern world history - was a truly landmark moment, carrying enormous implications for the natural environment, for intellectual thought, and for the international economy.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">When Worlds Collide</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">Many of Hollywood's most popular science fiction films--from The Day the Earth Stood Still to E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial and Independence Day--examine encounters with aliens. In 1492, a "close encounter of the 'third kind'" (physical contact) actually took place, as groups of people who had never known of each others existence collided.</p><p class="content-inject">Let’s take a look at how Hollywood and Europeans prior to 1492 imagined aliens.</p>

				<p class="content-inject">Do Earthlings and aliens meet in peace, or do the aliens seek to enslave or exterminate the human race?</p><p class="content-inject">Supposed sightings of flying saucers in 1947 ignited a frenzy of interest in Unidentified Flying Objects and aliens.</p><p class="content-inject">Since the sci-fi heyday of the 1950s – a decade which saw both the dawn of the real-world space age, and a continually escalating threat of global nuclear war – mainstream cinema has been somewhat obsessed with the subject of alien invasion, offering as it does the opportunity for audiences to reflect on real-world crises while reveling in escapist spectacle.</p>

				<h3 class="content-head">European Conceptions of the Other</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">During the decade before 1492, as Columbus nursed a growing urge to sail west to the Indies, he studied the old writers to find out what the world and its people were like. He read the Ymago Mundi of Pierre d'Ailly, a French cardinal who wrote in the early 15th century, the travels of Marco Polo and of Sir John Mandeville, Pliny's Natural History and the Historia Rerum Ubique Gestarum of Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini. Columbus was not a scholarly man. Yet he studied these books, made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong, the kind of ideas that the self-educated person gains from independent reading and clings to in defiance of what anyone else tries to tell him.</p><p class="content-inject">Among the most influential books was The Travels of Sir John Mandeville (1371). It purports to recount the author's travels through Jerusalem, Egypt, Turkistan, India, China, and other places. Actually it is a skillful compilation from the recorded travels of other people—e.g., Marco Polo, Ordoric of Pordenone, and William of Boldensele—into which Mandeville interpolated extravagant details of medieval lore.</p><p class="content-inject">Mandeville tells of islands whose inhabitants had the bodies of humans but the heads of dogs, of a tribe whose only source of nourishment was the smell of apples, of a people the size of pygmies whose mouths were so small that they had to suck all their food through reeds, and of a race of one-eyed giants who ate only raw fish and raw meat. All of this fantasy was interwoven with other geographical descriptions that were perfectly accurate.</p>

				<h3 class="content-head">Why Did It Take So Long to Regularly Cross the Atlantic?</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">The Atlantic Ocean was the last large body of water on Earth to be mastered. Ancient navigators voyaged across the Mediterranean even before historical records marked their journeys. The Pacific was crossed by Polynesians from the time of Christ and the Indian Ocean was crisscrossed with trading boats long before the common era began.</p><p class="content-inject">But it was not until the 15th century that the Atlantic became a regular channel of navigation. There were crossings before, but they did not make the Atlantic the highway that other large bodies of water had become centuries earlier.</p><p class="content-inject">To understand why it took so long to master the Atlantic, one must understand the difficulties of sailing wind powered ships on such a body of water. The Atlantic has strong currents and winds.</p><p class="content-inject">The key to crossing the Atlantic in a sailing craft lies in identifying the outbound and inbound currents. Columbus discovered these, and this discovery allowed him to sail straight into the Atlantic.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">Christopher Columbus</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">A newspaper cartoon showed a sign in the front window of Jack’s Department Store: “Columbus Day Sale. All merchandise marked up 200 percent. Because, let’s face it, Columbus was a greedy opportunist, just like Jack.”</p><p class="content-inject">To a generation of school children, Columbus was a man of mythic stature, an explorer and discoverer who initiated the modern age and carried European civilization across the Atlantic Ocean. Lately, Columbus has been depicted as an imperialist, a racist, and a genocidal despoiler of the natural environment. Indian peoples called Columbus the father of colonial greed, slavery, and genocide. In 1992, the National Council of Churches voted to condemn Columbus’s arrival as a genocide.</p><p class="content-inject">At 2 a.m., October 12, 1492, a sailor on board the Spanish ship the Pinta sighted a distant cliff in the moonlight. For 88 weary men who had been sailing for nine weeks in search of Asia, the sight was a godsend. Members of the crew had been talking of mutiny for several days, but now they asked for forgiveness. At dawn, Columbus put ashore in full regalia and claimed the land in the name of the King and Queen of Spain.</p><p class="content-inject">When Columbus and his men came ashore, the native Indians, known as the Arawak, greeted them with food, water, and gifts. This is the way Columbus described the encounter:</p><p class="content-inject">“They brought us parrots and balls of cotton and many other things, which they exchanged for glass beads. They willingly traded everything they owned. They do not bear arms and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge, and cut themselves out of ignorance. With 50 men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.”</p><p class="content-inject">On the basis of Columbus’s report, a second expedition was given 17 ships and more than 1,200 sailors. Their aim was clear: gold and slaves. In Haiti, Columbus and his men rounded up 1,500 Arawak and put them in pens guarded by dogs. Five hundred were loaded on ships and taken to Spain. Some 200 died en route. Columbus also ordered all Indians 14 or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months. When they handed over that amount, the Indians were given copper tokens to hang around their necks. Indians without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death.</p>

				<h3 class="content-head">Conclusion</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">1492 is the most significant year in modern world history. Not only did it bring the Old and New Worlds together, it also initiated a set of changes that would have vast implications for the future.</p><p class="content-inject">It contributed to the rise of the transatlantic slave trade and a vast movement of people, animals, food, plants, and diseases that would transform the world.</p><p class="content-inject">Alfred Crosby, a Professor Emeritus, University of Texas at Austin, stated:</p><p class="content-inject">"Millions of years ago, continental drift carried the Old World and New Worlds apart, splitting North and South America from Eurasia and Africa. That separation lasted so long that it fostered divergent evolution; for instance, the development of rattlesnakes on one side of the Atlantic and vipers on the other. After 1492, human voyagers in part reversed this tendency. Their artificial re-establishment of connections through the commingling of Old and New World plants, animals, and bacteria, commonly known as the Columbian Exchange, is one of the more spectacular and significant ecological events of the past millennium."</p>
