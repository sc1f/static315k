		<p class="content-inject">A host of myths surround Christopher Columbus and his epic voyage. One such myth is that he was the first person to recognize that the earth was round. In fact, all educated people knew that the world was spherical, though there was disagreement about its diameter. In the end, Columbus grossly underestimated the earth’s circumference.</p><p class="content-inject">One such myth is that Queen Isabella sold her crown jewels to pay for his voyage. Not true. The city of Palos owed the Queen a debt, which it repaid by providing two of Columbus’s ships.</p><p class="content-inject">Then there is the myth that Columbus was the first European to set foot in what is now the United States. In fact, Columbus never set foot on North America.</p><p class="content-inject">But the most powerful myth is that Columbus was the first person to recognize that the earth is round. In fact, all educated people of his time knew that the earth was spherical, though there was sharp disagreement about its circumference, which Columbus radically underestimated.</p><p class="content-inject">So how then did this myth arise? It was popularized in an 1828 multi-volume biography by Washington Irving, best remembered today as the author of “Rip Van Winkle” and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Entitled A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, the book asserted that Columbus alone advocated that the earth was round in the face of a religious establishment that insisted that the world was flat.</p><p class="content-inject">Washington Irving was influential in creating many popular myths and legends. In addition to the Headless Horseman, he was among the first to popularize St. Nicholas (who later generations would call “Santa Claus”) as a pipe-smoking figure who brings gifts down chimneys at Christmas time.</p><p class="content-inject">Why do you think that Irving, himself a devout Episcopalian who played a crucial role in creating a native American literature, may have created the Columbus myth?</p>
