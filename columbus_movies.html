		<p class="content-inject">Where do Americans learn their history these days?</p><p class="content-inject">At the movies, of course.</p><p class="content-inject">In our increasingly visual culture, much of what the public knows about the past comes from the movies.</p><p class="content-inject">Many historians are highly critical of historical movies. They are travesties, some say, playing fast and loose with the facts.</p><p class="content-inject">It is true: Popular films often distort history.  Historical films movies are filled with inaccuracies, simplifications, invented dialogue and imagined characters, imagined dialogue, anachronisms, and improbabilities.  Frequently such movies inject romance into the plot.  Worse yet, films often populate the screen with clearly identified heroes and villains, and promote a “Great Man” view of history, overemphasizing the role of certain powerful individuals.</p><p class="content-inject">But historical films can also be a valuable source of information.  Such movies can help us visualize another time and place and introduce the audience to important episodes from the past.</p><p class="content-inject">Historical movies always contain a mixture of truth, illusion, history, and fantasy and it can be helpful to tease out these elements.</p><p class="content-inject">We've all heard the phrase: "It's just a movie." Movies, we often hear, are just entertainment. In fact, movies are educators. Films provide information and misinformation. Some of the best historical films challenge deeply engrained mythologies and force the audience to confront the complex realities of the past.</p><p class="content-inject">The year 1992 brought two big budget films about Columbus to the screen: 1492: The Conquest of Paradise and Christopher Columbus: The Discovery. View the trailers to these films and briefly decode the messages that the trailers convey. Describe how they depict Columbus and how they seek to generate audience interest in a figure they first met in grade school.</p>
