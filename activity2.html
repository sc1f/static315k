		<p class="content-inject a-intro">When the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller published the first map to depict the New World in 1507, he called the Western hemisphere America in honor of the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci. Why Vespucci and not Columbus?</p><p class="content-inject">An Italian merchant, born in 1454 in Florence, Vespucci made two voyages between 1499 and 1502 and possibly a third one in 1503. On his first voyage in 1499, he explored South America’s northern coast and gave it names like “the Gulf of the Ganges.”</p><p class="content-inject">On his second voyage, he followed the coast of South America nearly to its southern tip, and realized that he had encountered an entirely new continent. It was this that led Waldseemüller to name the New World after Vespucci:</p><p class="content-inject">"I see no reason why anyone should justly object to calling this part ... America, after Amerigo [Vespucci], its discoverer, a man of great ability."</p><p class="content-inject">So who should the New World have been named after? Columbus, who was the first fifteenth century European to reach the New World, or Vespucci, the first person to recognize that he had reached a new continent?</p>
