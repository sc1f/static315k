				<h3 class="content-head">Why Columbus’s Voyages Mattered</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">Columbus, of course, was not the first European to discover the New World. The Norse established settlements in North America around the year 1,000. Others may have reached the New World even earlier. Yet those early voyages made no difference.</p><p class="content-inject">Why, then, did Columbus’s voyages matter?</p><p class="content-inject">Because broader circumstances ensured that his voyages would not be a transient event. It reflected three factors: the rise of European nations in competition with one another for trade; the rise of a merchant class hungry for trade and new markets; and the cutting off of traditional European trading routes as a result of the expanding power of the Ottoman Empire.</p><p class="content-inject">European monarchies were desperate to find ways to finance the state, and especially the military. Overseas trade offered one possible solution. Merchants, with financing from banks in Italy and Germany, were eager to seize on trading opportunities. And equally important, the rise of the Ottoman Empire cut off earlier trading routes.</p><p class="content-inject">By the late 15th century, after the Ottoman Empire had captured Constantinople, the center of eastern Christianity, the time was ripe for a new approach. Portugal led the way, exploring and developing trading relations along Africa’s western coast. Portugal also thought that it could develop ties with a mythical Christian kingdom in Africa led by a ruler known as Prester John. In 1488, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias sailed around the southernmost tip of Africa in 1488, and reached the Indian Ocean, opening a new route to India and China.</p><p class="content-inject">Meanwhile, Spain, inspired by the Portuguese example, also sought to identify new trading opportunities. It was widely known that the Earth was round. Columbus estimated that the Earth was half its actual size and was given the opportunity to test his theory.</p>

				<h3 class="content-head">The Columbian Exchange</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">The Columbian Exchange refers to the global diffusion of plants, animals, diseases, and human populations after 1492. Geographical zones which had been previously isolated now became interconnected with profound consequences for the diet, the natural environment, health, and the size and distribution of the human population.</p><p class="content-inject">As a result of the Columbian Exchange, the human population, overall, grew rapidly. But in the Americas, the spread of disease pathogens resulted in decline of 50 to 90 percent in the indigenous population by 1650. In Africa, population growth helped to make the Atlantic slave trade possible. The slave trade, in turn, resulted in the loss of many men of prime working age in west and central Africa, producing a population that was sharply skewed along lines of sex and age.</p><p class="content-inject">The Columbian Exchange also contributed to the growth in Europe of a modern consumer economy. Sugar, coffee, tea, and tobacco would be consumed not just by elites but by a mass consumer market. Each of these products, it should be noted, is addictive and psychoactive, with an impact on brain functioning. Each is a stimulant; coffee, tea, and tobacco also increase the mind’s ability to concentrate.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">Sugar</h3><p class="content-inject">People’s love of sweetness had a huge impact on history.</p><p class="content-inject">From its origins in New Guinea around 8000 B.C., sugar cane spread to the Philippines and India, and then moved westward along with Arab traders and eventually found its way to Europe around 996 A.D. Cultivation requires tropical conditions with much water and no cold spells. Hence, it could be raised in northern Africa and in parts of the Mediterranean (i.e., Crete and Cyprus), but yields were low. This made sugar rare and expensive in Europe.</p><p class="content-inject">The Spanish and Portugese experimented with raising sugar in other places, notably on islands off the coast of Africa. It was there that Columbus learned about growing sugar cane. He would introduce sugar cane into the islands in the Caribbean that he encountered.</p><p class="content-inject">Cultivating and processing sugar cane is such arduous work that no one is willing to do it voluntarily. Working cane, harvesting, milling, and cooking the juice is arduous physical labor. Slave labor or indentured servants was an integral part of the sugar trade.</p><p class="content-inject">Sugar was the single most important force behind the growth of New World slavery.</p><p class="content-inject">Sugar cane, which had been extremely rare and costly and had been used as a medicine, became an essential part of the diet, consumed in great quantities even by the poor. Sugar not only provided cheap calories, allowing people to work harder, it also provided workers with a reason to work hard.</p> 
				<h3 class="content-head">Spices</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">It was the quest for spices that led Vasco de Gama to sail around the tip of Africa to India and Ferdinand Magellan to seek to navigate the globe. Today, we take spices for granted, but prior to the 17th century, spices were extremely costly – so costly that some merchants adulterated spices with silver shavings.</p><p class="content-inject">Because they came from the Far East, spices were associated with the exotic. Spices were also laden with religious and medical significance. Spices were used as therapeutics, tonics, and even as aphrodisiacs. Doctors prescribed spices as a way to balance the "humors" in food. Salt was associated with fertility and provided the root for the word “salacious,” which refers to something that appeals to the sexual imagination.  Due to spices’ rarity and expense, elites used spices heavily to demonstrate their wealth.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">Contrary to popular belief, spices were not generally used to preserve food – though they did mask the taste of rotten meat. Spices were used for flavoring, not food preservation. Food were typically preserved through drying or salting.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">The Great Food Exchange</h3><p class="content-inject">Imagine Italian food without tomatoes or Hungarian cuisine without paprika or Korea without spicy Kimchee, or Indian or Thai cuisine without spicy chili peppers or Switzerland or the Netherlands without chocolate.</p><p class="content-inject">The Columbian exchange introduced sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas to the New World, and potatoes, corn, and cacao to Europe, cassava (also known as manioc), corn, and yams to Africa. Green beans, spicy peppers, pineapple, peanuts, turkey, and vanilla, all from the New World, broadened Old World diets. Meanwhile, chickens, goats, pigs, and sheep, as well as wheat, chickpeas, and a host of vegetables drastically altered New World diets.</p><p class="content-inject">No crop had a greater impact than the lowly potato, since an acre and a half could support a family for a year. In Ireland, where farmers might consume as much as ten pounds of potatoes a day, spuds allowed the population to nearly triple between the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries. But when a blight, which arrived from the New World, devastated the potato crop beginning in 1845, nearly a million people in Ireland died and another million migrated.</p><p class="content-inject">The Great Food Exchange not only resulted in significant improvements in caloric and nutritional intake, fueling rapid population growth, but contributed to the growth of national identity, as specific foods became associated with national cultures. Various foods were used in radically different ways. Potatoes were distilled into Vodka in Russia, served cold in salads in Germany, boiled in Ireland, and fried in France.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">Disease</h3><p class="content-inject">Imagine if the population of New York City suddenly dropped by fifty to 90 percent – from 8.4 million to as little as 840,000. That’s what happened to the Indian peoples of Mexico, Brazil, Peru, the Caribbean, and North America in the first centuries after 1492.</p><p class="content-inject">At its very worst, from 1347 to 1351, the Black Death killed one third of the people in Europe. But what happened in the New World was far worse. Smallpox, chickenpox, typhoid, bubonic plague, diphtheria, influenza, mumps, measles, and whooping cough, later followed by cholera, malaria, and scarlet fever, radically reduced the size of the indigenous population.</p><p class="content-inject">The peoples of the Western Hemisphere and of Oceania had no inherited or acquired immunity to the diseases of Europe, Africa, or Asia.</p>

			<h3 class="content-head">Impact on the Indiginous Population</h3>
			<p class="content-inject">Alexis de Tocqueville, a French observer who visited the United States in the 1830s, asserted that the North America, prior to Columbus, was an “empty continent…awaiting its [new] inhabitants.” The U.S. Bureau of the Census, writing in 1894, took a similar position. “Investigation shows,” the bureau concluded, “that the aboriginal population within the present United States at the beginning of the Columbian period could not have exceeded much over 500,000.”</p><p class="content-inject">Current estimates of the Indian population north of Mexico are far higher, ranging from about 2 million to 18 million, with the consensus at about 7 million. There is no disagreement, however, that the size of the indigenous population fell sharply after 1492. By 1900, the Indian population in the United States, Canada, and Greenland had declined to just 375,000, the result of disease, disruption of social systems, exploitation, and warfare – all contributed to the decline in the size of the indigenous population.</p><p class="content-inject">Much of the decline resulted from disease: smallpox, measles, the bubonic plague, cholera, typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet fever, various forms of influenza and whooping cough, malaria, and yellow fever as well as some venereal diseases. But colonial contact itself had a powerful impact. Such factors as displacement and mass relocation, forced labor, warfare, and changes in the ecology not only sharply increased death rates but reduced birth rates.</p><p class="content-inject">How do we know? After all, systemic censuses only appeared much later, with the first national census counts taking place in Sweden in 1749, the United States in 1790, and Britain and France in 1801. China did not conduct its first census until 1953.</p><p class="content-inject">One source of information lies in the estimates made by explorers, missionaries, soldiers, and other observers about specific Indian tribes. This was the method employed by James Mooney, a Smithsonian ethnologist. Assuming that the observers exaggerated the size of the Indian population, he took their lowest estimates he could find. His tribe-by-tribe estimate, published in 1928, concluded that there were 1.15 million Indians north of Mexico in 1492.</p><p class="content-inject">Another approach is to estimate the population density that specific geographical areas could support. This was how the anthropologist Alfred Kroeber arrived at his 1934 estimate that the Indian population north of the Rio Grande River was about 4.2 million in 1492.</p><p class="content-inject">More recently, scholars have tapped a wide variety of sources to reconstruct the size of the pre-contact Indian population. These include counts of the number of Indian warriors, baptismal and tax records, accounts of epidemics, acreage devoted to raising corn and beans to estimate food supply, and even the number of canoes. The result was to sharply raise the estimated population.</p>

			<h3 class="content-head">The Environmental Consequences of the Columbian Exchange</h3>
			<p class="content-inject">The Columbian Exchange had profound consequences for the natural environment.</p>
			<p class="content-inject">Wildlife was extraordinarily abundant at the time of European contact. Passenger pigeons darkened the skies. Deer congregated by the hundreds. A single net in Virginia caught 5,000 sturgeon. Observers reported seeing crabs and oysters a foot in length, and lobsters as large as five or even six feet long.</p>
			<p class="content-inject">The area north of Mexico was not unbroken forest. East of the Mississippi, Indian peoples cleared fields with fire, resulting in an environment consisting of widely spaced trees and relatively few shrubs, providing room for deer, elk, porcupine, quail, rabbits, and turkeys. The abundance of game also encouraged such predators as eagles, foxes, hawks, and wolves.</p>
			<p class="content-inject">Many indigenous peoples east of the Mississippi River plowed and sowed crops including corn, potatoes, pumpkin, and squash. In the Southwest, the Anasazi devised a complex system of dikes and dams to water fields.</p>
			<p class="content-inject">The arrival of Europeans changed the face of the land. The newcomers introduced grasses, plants, and weeds including clover, dandelions, and ragweed. The introduction of cattle, pigs, and sheep, too, reshaped the natural environment. There would also be a huge European demand for the furs of beaver, foxes, martens, muskrats, and otters, and later for buffalo hides, as well as for wood.</p>
			<p class="content-inject">After 1492, the human ability to exploit the natural environment greatly increased. Over time, many fur bearing animals would be hunted to near extinction. Sea creatures, too, especially cod and whales, would be radically reduced in numbers.</p>

				<h3 class="content-head">Three Forms of European Expansion</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">European expansion into the Americas, Africa, and Asia took three forms: Conquest, commerce, and colonial settlement.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">Conquest</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">Conquest took place where there was a large indigenous population and Europeans succeeded in defeating a preexisting state apparatus and then ruled, directly or indirectly, in its place. In the Americas, conquest took place in Mexico and Peru. In Africa, it took place only in Angola.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">How was it, one might ask, that 600 Spanish able to conquer the Aztec Empire in Mexico and just 110 foot soldiers and 67 cavalry able to conquer the Inca Empire in Peru?</p>
				<p class="content-inject">At one time, the answer was said to lie in the Europeans’ overwhelming military superiority, with guns, horses, and steel weapons making the difference.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">In fact, European weaponry was not decisive. Armored cavalry and projectile weapons were not especially effective in the New World. The Europeans were seriously outnumbered and their weapons were slow to fire.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">Conquest succeeded not because of Spain’s military superiority but because the Spanish Conquistadors were able to play groups off against one another. In Mexico and Peru, the Spanish succeeded by forging military alliances with groups that had been subjugated by the Aztecs and Incas. And Spain succeeded in governing its empire by working through their allies existing systems of government. The Spanish recognized the indigenous rules and gave these “caciques” rights to land.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">Europeans were also aided by disease, which demoralized and weakened the Indian population.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">Commerce</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">Commerce took place where the Europeans were unable to defeat the native population militarily, both because of the fighting prowess of the indigenous people or of the small number of Europeans willing to migrate.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">With the exception of Angola (conquered by Portugal in 1575) and a number of small islands off the coast of Africa and the Philippines (conquered by Spain in 1570), Europeans were unable to conquer any parts of Africa or Asia. All the Europeans were able to do was establish trading centers to import spices, silk, and porcelain from East Asia and gold, ivory, and slaves from Africa.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">By the mid-16th century, Portugal had already established fifty trading posts. England would concentrate on trade with India; the Dutch in Cape Town in what is now South Africa, Colombo in what is now Sri Lanka, and the southern Pacific, especially Java (or what is now Indonesia). To support trade, England and the Netherlands established government-supported trading companies. The English East India Trading Company was established in 1600 and the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) in 1602.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">In French Quebec, relatively few French were willing to migrate, probably fewer than 3,000. Those who did engaged in trade with the Indians usually involving beaver furs. Few French women migrated and a large mixed race population arose.</p>
				<!-- The following map shows European trading posts in Africa and Asia around 1700. -->
				<h3 class="content-head">Colonial Settlement</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">Settler colonies arose where the indigenous peoples were not powerful enough to expel the invaders and not producing enough wealth to make it worthwhile to allow them to continue to rule.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">The first colonies were in islands off the coast of Europe such as Madeira, the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands, and Sao Tome, which were all colonized before Columbus sailed to the New World. These were followed by the Caribbean, coastal Brazil, and coastal North America, beginning with Spanish Florida and moving northward.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">England was especially likely to form settler colonies in the Caribbean and North America. In contrast to the Spanish and Portuguese, the English, for the most part, did not intermarry with Indians. Instead, the English displaced the indigenous peoples and repopulated the area with English settlers and, over time, with enslaved Africans. This process of displacement is known as “plantation settlement.”</p>
				<p class="content-inject">Lacking conquered or enslaved Indians, the northern Europeans relied initially on indentured servants from their homelands. These servants agreed to a contract to labor for a period of time with the promise that they could become landowners at the end of their term. The term was 3 to 7 years in length. Faced with growing difficulty in attracting indentured servants, the English increasingly relied upon enslaved Africans as a source of labor.</p>
				<h3 class="content-head">Differences Between Spanish, French, and English Colonization</h3>
				<p class="content-inject">One important difference in Spanish, French, and English colonizers was in their attitude toward the indigenous population. The Spanish viewed the Indian population as a usable labor force, that could be used to mine for gold and silver, raise agricultural crops, and work in primitive factories. The French, in Canada, regarded the Indians as trading partners and military allies. The English, in general, had no interest in coexistence. For Spain, the removal or extermination of the Indian population was not a feasible possibility, since despite the impact of disease, the Indian population remained very large. But in the areas settled by the English along the Atlantic coast, the Indian population was more loosely spread out over large areas.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">England’s first experience with colonization took place in Ireland, which carried farreaching implications for the treatment of Native Americans. The English during the 15th and 16th centuries viewed the Irish as barbarians who were only nominally Christian. The English sought to pursh the Irish out of desirable areas and replace them with English or Scots.</p>
				<p class="content-inject">Another key difference lay in the number and sex ratio of the populations. Not only would the English migrate in much greater numbers, but their sex ratio was much more even than among the Spanish or French. A third difference was that while the Spain’s New World Empire, and to a lesser extent, the French, were centrally controlled, the English colonies, initially, were far more decentralized, with private groups or companies responsible for their founding.</p>
