Module 3:	The Significance of 1492

The collision of cultures that took place in 1492 has consequences that are still unfolding today. New foods reshaped the diets of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.  Sugar, coffee, cattle, pigs, and sheep reached the Americas, while corn, tobacco, tomatoes, and potatoes came to Africa, Asia, and Europe. The New World environment was transformed as Europeans cleared vast tracts of forested land and introduced cattle, goats, horses, sheep, and swine as well as Old World grasses and weeds. The European discovery of the New World also resulted in the sharpest population decline in human history, as millions of Indians died from smallpox, measles, and other epidemic diseases. With the New World population decimated by disease, Europeans gradually introduced a new labor force: enslaved Africans. By the late eighteenth century, Europeans were debating whether Columbus's discovery of the New World had added to or subtracted from human happiness.


Three Worlds Collide

Many of Hollywood’s most popular films deal with encounters with aliens. Think Avatar, Star Wars, E.T., and Independence Day.  In this module, we will examine a real life encounter between among aliens who never imagined the other’s existence. 

This is a story far more interesting than anything Hollywood could imagine.  It is also a story of death and destruction on a scale beyond even Hollywood’s imaginings.


The Significance of 1492

The four hundredth anniversary of Christopher Columbus's "discovery" of the New World was commemorated with a massive "Columbian Exhibition" in Chicago in 1893. The exhibition celebrated Columbus as a man of mythic stature, an explorer and discoverer who carried Christian civilization across the Atlantic Ocean and initiated the modern age.
	
The five hundredth anniversary of Columbus's first voyage of discovery was treated quite differently. Many peoples of indigenous and African descent identified Columbus with imperialism, colonialism, and conquest. The National Council of Churches adopted a resolution calling October 12th a day of mourning for millions of indigenous people who died as a result of European colonization.
	
More than five hundred years after the first Spaniards arrived in the Caribbean, historians and the general public still debate Columbus's legacy. Should he be remembered as a great discoverer who brought European culture to a previously unknown world? Or should he be condemned as a man responsible for an "American Holocaust," a man who brought devastating European and Asian diseases to unprotected native peoples, disrupted the American ecosystem, and initiated the Atlantic slave trade? What is Columbus's legacy--discovery and progress, or slavery, disease, and racial antagonism?
	
To confront such questions, one must first recognize that the encounter that began in 1492 among the peoples of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres was one of the truly epochal events in world history. This cultural collision not only produced an extraordinary transformation of the natural environment and human cultures in the New World, it also initiated far-reaching changes in the Old World as well. 
	
New foods reshaped the diets of people in both hemispheres. Tomatoes, chocolate, potatoes, corn, green beans, peanuts, vanilla, pineapple, and turkey transformed the European diet, while Europeans introduced sugar, cattle, pigs, cloves, ginger, cardamon, and almonds to the Americas. Global patterns of trade were overturned, as crops grown in the New World---including tobacco, rice, and vastly expanded production of sugar--fed growing consumer markets in Europe.
	
Even the natural environment was transformed. Europeans cleared vast tracks of forested land and inadvertently introduced Old World weeds. The introduction of cattle, goats, horses, sheep, and swine also transformed the ecology as grazing animals ate up many native plants and disrupted indigenous systems of agriculture. The horse, extinct in the New World for 10,000 years, transformed the daily existence of many indigenous peoples. The introduction of the horse encouraged many farming peoples to become hunters and herders. Hunters mounted on horses were also much more adept at killing game.
	
Death and disease--these too were consequences of contact. Diseases against which Indian peoples had no natural immunities caused the greatest mass deaths in human history. Within a century of contact, smallpox, measles, mumps, and whooping cough had reduced indigenous populations by 50 to 90 percent. From Peru to Canada, disease reduced the resistance that Native Americans were able to offer to European intruders.
	
With the Indian population decimated by disease, Europeans gradually introduces a new labor force into the New World: enslaved Africans. Between 1502 and 1870, when the Atlantic slave trade was finally suppressed, from ten to fifteen million Africans were shipped to the Americas.
	
Columbus's voyage of discovery also had another important result: it contributed to the development of the modern concept of progress. To many Europeans, the New World seemed to be a place of innocence, freedom, and eternal youth. The perception of the New World as an environment free from the corruptions and injustices of European life would provide a vantage point for criticizing all social evils. So while the collision of three worlds resulted in death and enslavement in unprecedented numbers, it also encouraged visions of a more perfect future.

Columbus's voyages represent one of the major discontinuities in human history. His voyages truly represented a historical watershed, with vast repercussions for all aspects of life in both the Old World and the New. The year 1492 - perhaps more than any other year in modern world history - was a truly landmark moment, carrying enormous implications for the natural environment, for intellectual thought, and for the international economy.


When Worlds Collide

Many of Hollywood's most popular science fiction films--from The Day the Earth Stood Still to E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial and Independence Day--examine encounters with aliens. In 1492, a "close encounter of the 'third kind'" (physical contact) actually took place, as groups of people who had never known of each others existence collided.

Let’s take a look at how Hollywood and Europeans prior to 1492 imagined aliens.


Cinematic Encounters with Aliens

Do Earthlings and aliens meet in peace, or do the aliens seek to enslave or exterminate the human race?

Supposed sightings of flying saucers in 1947 ignited a frenzy of interest in Unidentified Flying Objects and aliens.

Since the sci-fi heyday of the 1950s – a decade which saw both the dawn of the real-world space age, and a continually escalating threat of global nuclear war – mainstream cinema has been somewhat obsessed with the subject of alien invasion, offering as it does the opportunity for audiences to reflect on real-world crises while reveling in escapist spectacle.

The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)

An alien named Klaatu arrives in Washington, D.C. in a flying saucer.  Even though he and his companions announce that they have come in peace, their arrival triggers panic. A nervous soldier shoots Klaatu, but he comes back to life and delivers a message from the Galactic Federation: Either Earth must live in peace under the rule of Klaatu’s robot servant Gort, or it will be destroyed.

War of the Worlds (1953)

Earth is under attack in this updating of H.G. Wells’s science fiction tale to the Cold War era as invaders from another world target a small California town with autonomous probes and laser disintegration rays.

Earth vs. The Flying Saucers (1956)

Scientist Russell Marvin is on-hand when an alien spacecraft lands on earth. The aliens at first insist that they've come in peace, but Marvin suspects otherwise. Sure enough, the visitors eventually declare their intention to take over the earth within the next 60 days, adding that the military's weapons are useless against them. The two-month window gives Marvin and his cohorts plenty of time to build-up superweapon, and thus stave off the seven-saucer invasion force.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)

Emotionless aliens from outer space are using large seed pods to duplicate human bodies and take them over.

E.T.: The Extraterrestrial (1982)

An alien spacecraft on a scientific mission mistakenly left behind an aging botanist who isn't sure how to get home. Eventually Elliott puts his fears aside and makes contact with the "little squashy guy," perhaps the least threatening alien invader ever to hit a movie screen. As Elliott tries to keep the alien under wraps and help him figure out a way to get home, he discovers that the creature can communicate with him telepathically. Soon they begin to learn from each other, and Elliott becomes braver and less threatened by life. E.T. rigs up a communication device from junk he finds around the house, but no one knows if he'll be rescued before a group of government scientists gets hold of him.

Independence Day (1996)

A series of massive spaceships approach Earth, which many greet with open arms, looking forward to the first contact with alien life. Unfortunately, these extraterrestrials have not come in peace, and they unleash powerful weapons that destroy most of the world's major cities. Thrown into chaos, the survivors struggle to band together and put up a last-ditch resistance in order to save the human race.


European Conceptions of the Other

During the decade before 1492, as Columbus nursed a growing urge to sail west to the Indies, he studied the old writers to find out what the world and its people were like. He read the Ymago Mundi of Pierre d'Ailly, a French cardinal who wrote in the early 15th century, the travels of Marco Polo and of Sir John Mandeville, Pliny's Natural History and the Historia Rerum Ubique Gestarum of Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini. Columbus was not a scholarly man. Yet he studied these books, made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong, the kind of ideas that the self-educated person gains from independent reading and clings to in defiance of what anyone else tries to tell him.

Among the most influential books was The Travels of Sir John Mandeville (1371).  It purports to recount the author's travels through Jerusalem, Egypt, Turkistan, India, China, and other places. Actually it is a skillful compilation from the recorded travels of other people—e.g., Marco Polo, Ordoric of Pordenone, and William of Boldensele—into which Mandeville interpolated extravagant details of medieval lore.

Mandeville tells of islands whose inhabitants had the bodies of humans but the heads of dogs, of a tribe whose only source of nourishment was the smell of apples, of a people the size of pygmies whose mouths were so small that they had to suck all their food through reeds, and of a race of one-eyed giants who ate only raw fish and raw meat. All of this fantasy was interwoven with other geographical descriptions that were perfectly accurate.




Question:  How do you think such images may have influenced Columbus’s ideas about the New World Indians?


Why Did It Take So Long to Regularly Cross the Atlantic?

The Atlantic Ocean was the last large body of water on Earth to be mastered.  Ancient navigators voyaged across the Mediterranean even before historical records marked their journeys. The Pacific was crossed by Polynesians from the time of Christ and the Indian Ocean was crisscrossed with trading boats long before the common era began.  

But it was not until the 15th century that the Atlantic became a regular channel of navigation. There were crossings before, but they did not make the Atlantic the highway that other large bodies of water had become centuries earlier.

To understand why it took so long to master the Atlantic, one must understand the difficulties of sailing wind powered ships on such a body of water. The Atlantic has strong currents and winds.

The key to crossing the Atlantic in a sailing craft lies in identifying the outbound and inbound currents.  Columbus discovered these, and this discovery allowed him to sail straight into the Atlantic.




Christopher Columbus

A newspaper cartoon showed a sign in the front window of Jack’s Department Store: “Columbus Day Sale. All merchandise marked up 200 percent. Because, let’s face it, Columbus was a greedy opportunist, just like Jack.”

To a generation of school children, Columbus was a man of mythic stature, an explorer and discoverer who initiated the modern age and carried European civilization across the Atlantic Ocean.  Lately, Columbus has been depicted as an imperialist, a racist, and a genocidal despoiler of the natural environment.  Indian peoples called Columbus the father of colonial greed, slavery, and genocide.  In 1992, the National Council of Churches voted to condemn Columbus’s arrival as a genocide.

At 2 a.m., October 12, 1492, a sailor on board the Spanish ship the Pinta sighted a distant cliff in the moonlight.  For 88 weary men who had been sailing for nine weeks in search of Asia, the sight was a godsend.  Members of the crew had been talking of mutiny for several days, but now they asked for forgiveness.  At dawn, Columbus put ashore in full regalia and claimed the land in the name of the King and Queen of Spain.

When Columbus and his men came ashore, the native Indians, known as the Arawak, greeted them with food, water, and gifts.  This is the way Columbus described the encounter:

“They brought us parrots and balls of cotton and many other things, which they exchanged for glass beads.  They willingly trade d everything they owned. They do not bear arms and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge, and cut themselves out of ignorance.  With 50 men we could subjugate them all and make them  do whatever we want.”

On the basis of Columbus’s report, a second expedition was given 17 ships and more than 1,200 sailors.  Their aim was clear: gold and slaves.  In Haiti, Columbus and his men rounded up 1,500 Arawak and put them in pens guarded by dogs.  Five hundred were loaded on ships and taken to Spain.  Some 200 died en route.  Columbus also ordered all Indians 14 or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months.  When they handed over that amount, the Indians were given copper tokens to hang around their necks. Indians without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death.


Columbus Activities
	
1492 is the most significant year in modern world history. Not only did it bring the Old and New Worlds together, it also initiated a set of changes that would have vast implications for the future.

It contributed to the rise of the transatlantic slave trade and a vast movement of people, animals, food, plants, and diseases that would transform the world.

Alfred Crosby, a Professor Emeritus, University of Texas at Austin, stated:

Millions of years ago, continental drift carried the Old World and New Worlds apart, splitting North and South America from Eurasia and Africa. That separation lasted so long that it fostered divergent evolution; for instance, the development of rattlesnakes on one side of the Atlantic and vipers on the other. After 1492, human voyagers in part reversed this tendency. Their artificial re-establishment of connections through the commingling of Old and New World plants, animals, and bacteria, commonly known as the Columbian Exchange, is one of the more spectacular and significant ecological events of the past millennium.

Activity 1:  What Did Columbus Look Like?

Christopher Columbus, arguably, had a greater impact on the course of world history than anyone else in the past thousand years.  Yet we know remarkably little about him.  Encyclopedias and textbooks generally state that he was born in 1451 in Genoa, but serious scholars still dispute when and where he was born, his ethnicity, how he was educated, where he landed in 1492, and even where he is buried.

The 1893 commemoration of Columbus’s voyages of discovery, the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, displayed 71 portraits reputedly of Columbus.  None was painted from life.

But we do have two surviving written descriptions.  Read these, and then briefly explain why you think one of the following portraits is most accurate.

The earliest published description of Columbus appeared in 1504, and described him as “Genoese, a man of tall and imposing stature, ruddy, of great intelligence, and with a long face.” This description is attributed to Angelo Trivigiano, who was secretary to the Venetian ambassador at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella.

Three decades later, Conzalo Fernandez de Oviedo described him as a man “of good statre and appearance, taller than middling and with strong limbs, the eyes lively and other parts of the countenance of good proportion, the hair very red, and the face somewhat flushed and freckled.“

Fernando Colon described his father as follows;

The Admiral was a well-built man of more than average stature, the face long, the cheeks somewhat high, his body neither fat nor lean. He had an aquiline nose and light-colored eyes; his complexion was light and tending to bright red. In youth his hair was fair, but when he reached the age of thirty, it all turned white. In eating and drinking, and in the adornment of his person, he was very moderate and modest. He was affable in conversation with strangers and very pleasant to the members of his household, though with a certain gravity. He was so strict in matters of religion that for fasting and saying prayers he might have been taken for a member of a religious order. He was so great an enemy of swearing and blasphemy that I give my word I never heard him utter any other oath than ‘by St. Ferdinand!’ and when he grew very angry with someone his rebuke was to say ‘God take you’ for doing or saying that;. If he had to write anything, he always began by writing these words: IESUS cum MARIA sit nobis in via. And so fine was his hand that he might have earned his bread by that skill alone.

Based on these descriptions, explain which of the following portraits is probably most accurate.

Lorenzo Lotto, 1512

Activity 2:  When the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller published the first map to depict the New World in 1507, he called the Western hemisphere America in honor of the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci.  Why Vespucci and not Columbus?

An Italian merchant, born in 1454 in Florence, Vespucci made two voyages between 1499 and 1502 and possibly a third one in 1503.  On his first voyage in 1499, he explored South America’s northern coast and gave it names like “the Gulf of the Ganges.”

On his second voyage, he followed the coast of South America nearly to its southern tip, and realized that he had encountered an entirely new continent.  It was this that led Waldseemüller to name the New World after Vespucci:

I see no reason why anyone should justly object to calling this part ... America, after Amerigo [Vespucci], its discoverer, a man of great ability.

So who should the New World have been named after?  Columbus, who was the first fifteenth century European to reach the New World, or Vespucci, the first person to recognize that he had reached a new continent?


Activity 3:  Columbus and Mythmaking

A host of myths surround Christopher Columbus and his epic voyage.  One such myth is that he was the first person to recognize that the earth was round.  In fact, all educated people knew that the world was spherical, though there was disagreement about its diameter.  In the end, Columbus grossly underestimated the earth’s circumference.

One such myth is that Queen Isabella sold her crown jewels to pay for his voyage.  Not true.  The city of Palos owed the Queen a debt, which it repaid by providing two of Columbus’s ships.

Then there is the myth that Columbus was the first European to set foot in what is now the United States.  In fact, Columbus never set foot on North America.  

But the most powerful myth is that Columbus was the first person to recognize that the earth is round.  In fact, all educated people of his time knew that the earth was spherical, though there was sharp disagreement about its circumference, which Columbus radically underestimated.

So how then did this myth arise?  It was popularized in an 1828 multi-volume biography by Washington Irving, best remembered today as the author of “Rip Van Winkle” and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  Entitled A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, the book asserted that Columbus alone advocated that the earth was round in the face of a religious establishment that insisted that the world was flat.

Washington Irving was influential in creating many popular myths and legends.  In addition to the Headless Horseman, he was among the first to popularize St. Nicholas (who later generations would call “Santa Claus”) as a pipe-smoking figure who brings gifts down chimneys at Christmas time.

Why do you think that Irving, himself a devout Episcopalian who played a crucial role in creating a native American literature, may have created the Columbus myth?


Activity 4:  Judging Columbus. 

Historical reputations rise and fall, and Columbus’s is no exception.  Over time, he has been revered, reviled, and even ignored.  

During his own lifetime, his reputation had ups and downs.  Indeed, in 1500, he and his brothers were sent to Spain in chains, accused of brutality toward the native peoples and to the Spanish colonists.  

It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that Columbus, soon after the American revolution, that began to be celebrated as a brave, skillful, and visionary explorer.  The first Columbus Day celebration recorded in the United States took place in New York on October 12th, 1792.

The 400th anniversary of his epic voyage was marked by the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which attracted over a quarter of the U.S. population.  But it was not until 1937 that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed October 12th to be Columbus Day, a national holiday.

The 500th anniversary of the voyage of discovery generated intense controversy, with Columbus condemned by some as a genocidal exploiter of New World peoples, an initiator of the Atlantic slave trade, and a despoiler of the natural environment.  

So how might we best evaluate Columbus’s legacy, weighing his strengths, achievements, and flaws?  One window is offered by art.

Compare and contrast these two depictions of Spanish colonialism, one by the American painter John Vanderlyn (1775-1852) and the other by the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.  Both, notably, appear in key national buildings: The U.S. Capitol and Mexico’s National Palace.  What do these paintings say about popular attitudes toward Columbus in their respective countries?

Columbus at the Movies
 
Where do Americans learn their history these days?
 
At the movies, of course.
 
In our increasingly visual culture, much of what the public knows about the past comes from the movies.
 
Many historians are highly critical of historical movies. They are travesties, some say, playing fast and loose with the facts.
 
It is true: Popular films often distort history.  Historical films movies are filled with inaccuracies, simplifications, invented dialogue and imagined characters, imagined dialogue, anachronisms, and improbabilities.  Frequently such movies inject romance into the plot.  Worse yet, films often populate the screen with clearly identified heroes and villains, and promote a “Great Man” view of history, overemphasizing the role of certain powerful individuals.
 
But historical films can also be a valuable source of information.  Such movies can help us visualize another time and place and introduce the audience to important episodes from the past.
 
Historical movies always contain a mixture of truth, illusion, history, and fantasy and it can be helpful to tease out these elements. 
 
We've all heard the phrase: "It's just a movie." Movies, we often hear, are just entertainment.  In fact, movies are educators. Films provide information and misinformation.  Some of the best historical films challenge deeply engrained mythologies and force the audience to confront the complex realities of the past.
 
The year 1992 brought two big budget films about Columbus to the screen: 1492: The Conquest of Paradise and Christopher Columbus: The Discovery.  View the trailers to these films and briefly decode the messages that the trailers convey.  Describe how they depict Columbus and how they seek to generate audience interest in a figure they first met in grade school.

Why Columbus’s Voyages Mattered

Columbus, of course, was not the first European to discover the New World.  The Norse established settlements in North America around the year 1,000.  Others may have reached the New World even earlier.  Yet those early voyages made no difference.  

Why, then, did Columbus’s voyages matter?

Because broader circumstances ensured that his voyages would not be a transient event.  It reflected three factors: the rise of European nations in competition with one another for trade; the rise of a merchant class hungry for trade and new markets; and the cutting off of traditional European trading routes as a result of the expanding power of the Ottoman Empire.

European monarchies were desperate to find ways to finance the state, and especially the military.  Overseas trade offered one possible solution.  Merchants, with financing from banks in Italy and Germany, were eager to seize on trading opportunities.  And equally important, the rise of the Ottoman Empire cut off earlier trading routes.  

By the late 15th century, after the Ottoman Empire had captured Constantinople, the center of eastern Christianity, the time was ripe for a new approach. Portugal led the way, exploring and developing trading relations along Africa’s western coast.  Portugal also thought that it could develop ties with a mythical Christian kingdom in Africa led by a ruler known as Prester John.  In 1488, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias sailed around the southernmost tip of Africa in 1488, and reached the Indian Ocean, opening a new route to India and China.

Meanwhile, Spain, inspired by the Portuguese example, also sought to identify new trading opportunities.  It was widely known that the Earth was round.  Columbus estimated that the Earth was half its actual size and was given the opportunity to test his theory.


The Columbian Exchange

The Columbian Exchange refers to the global diffusion of plants, animals, diseases, and human populations after 1492.  Geographical zones which had been previously isolated now became interconnected with profound consequences for the diet, the natural environment, health, and the size and distribution of the human population.

As a result of the Columbian Exchange, the human population, overall, grew rapidly.  But in the Americas, the spread of disease pathogens resulted in decline of 50 to 90 percent in the indigenous population by 1650.  In Africa, population growth helped to make the Atlantic slave trade possible.  The slave trade, in turn, resulted in the loss of many men of prime working age in west and central Africa, producing a population that was sharply skewed along lines of sex and age.

The Columbian Exchange also contributed to the growth in Europe of a modern consumer economy.  Sugar, coffee, tea, and tobacco would be consumed not just by elites but by a mass consumer market.  Each of these products, it should be noted, is addictive and psychoactive, with an impact on brain functioning.  Each is a stimulant; coffee, tea, and tobacco also increase the mind’s ability to concentrate.  

The Great Food Exchange

Sugar 

People’s love of sweetness had a huge impact on history. 

From its origins in New Guinea around 8000 B.C., sugar cane spread to the Philippines and India, and then moved westward along with Arab traders and eventually found its way to Europe around 996 A.D.  Cultivation requires tropical conditions with much water and no cold spells. Hence, it could be raised in northern Africa and in parts of the Mediterranean (i.e., Crete and Cyprus), but yields were low. This made sugar rare and expensive in Europe.

The Spanish and Portugese experimented with raising sugar in other places, notably on islands off the coast of Africa.  It was there that Columbus learned about growing sugar cane. He would introduce sugar cane into the islands in the Caribbean that he encountered.

Cultivating and processing sugar cane is such arduous work that no one is willing to do it voluntarily. Working cane, harvesting, milling, and cooking the juice is arduous physical labor.  Slave labor or indentured servants was an integral part of the sugar trade.

Sugar was the single most important force behind the growth of New World slavery.

Sugar cane, which had been extremely rare and costly and had been used as a medicine, became an essential part of the diet, consumed in great quantities even by the poor.  Sugar not only provided cheap calories, allowing people to work harder, it also provided workers with a reason to work hard.  

Spices

It was the quest for spices that led Vasco de Gama to sail around the tip of Africa to India and Ferdinand Magellan to seek to navigate the globe.  Today, we take spices for granted, but prior to the 17th century, spices were extremely costly – so costly that some merchants adulterated spices with silver shavings.

Because they came from the Far East, spices were associated with the exotic. Spices were also laden with religious and medical significance.  Spices were used as therapeutics, tonics, and even as aphrodisiacs.  Doctors prescribed spices as a way to balance the "humors" in food.  Salt was associated with fertility and provided the root for the word “salacious,” which refers to something that appeals to the sexual imagination.   Due to spices’ rarity and expense, elites used spices heavily to demonstrate their wealth.

Contrary to popular belief, spices were not generally used to preserve food – though they did mask the taste of rotten meat. Spices were used for flavoring, not food preservation.  Food were typically preserved through drying or salting.

The Great Food Exchange

Imagine Italian food without tomatoes or Hungarian cuisine without paprika or Korea without spicy Kimchee, or Indian or Thai cuisine without spicy chili peppers or Switzerland or the Netherlands without chocolate.

The Columbian exchange introduced sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas to the New World, and potatoes, corn, and cacao to Europe, cassava (also known as manioc), corn, and yams to Africa.  Green beans, spicy peppers, pineapple, peanuts, turkey, and vanilla, all from the New World, broadened Old World diets.  Meanwhile, chickens, goats, pigs, and sheep, as well as wheat, chickpeas, and a host of vegetables drastically altered New World diets.

No crop had a greater impact than the lowly potato, since an acre and a half could support a family for a year.  In Ireland, where farmers might consume as much as ten pounds of potatoes a day, spuds allowed the population to nearly triple between the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries.  But when a blight, which arrived from the New World, devastated the potato crop beginning in 1845, nearly a million people in Ireland died and another million migrated.

The Great Food Exchange not only resulted in significant improvements in caloric and nutritional intake, fueling rapid population growth, but contributed to the growth of national identity, as specific foods became associated with national cultures. Various foods were used in radically different ways.  Potatoes were distilled into Vodka in Russia, served cold in salads in Germany, boiled in Ireland, and fried in France.

Disease

Imagine if the population of New York City suddenly dropped by fifty to 90 percent – from 8.4 million to as little as 840,000.  That’s what happened to the Indian peoples of Mexico, Brazil, Peru, the Caribbean, and North America in the first centuries after 1492.

At its very worst, from 1347 to 1351, the Black Death killed one third of the people in Europe. But what happened in the New World was far worse.  Smallpox, chickenpox, typhoid, bubonic plague, diphtheria, influenza, mumps, measles, and whooping cough, later followed by cholera, malaria, and scarlet fever, radically reduced the size of the indigenous population.

The peoples of the Western Hemisphere and of Oceania had no inherited or acquired immunity to the diseases of Europe, Africa, or Asia.
Geographical isolation


Impact on the Indigenous Population

Alexis de Tocqueville, a French observer who visited the United States in the 1830s, asserted that the North America, prior to Columbus, was an “empty continent…awaiting its [new] inhabitants.”  The U.S. Bureau of the Census, writing in 1894, took a similar position. “Investigation shows,” the bureau concluded, “that the aboriginal population within the present United States at the beginning of the Columbian period could not have exceeded much over 500,000.”
Current estimates of the Indian population north of Mexico are far higher, ranging from about 2 million to 18 million, with the consensus at about 7 million.  There is no disagreement, however, that the size of the indigenous population fell sharply after 1492.  By 1900, the Indian population in the United States, Canada, and Greenland had declined to just 375,000, the result of disease, disruption of social systems, exploitation, and warfare – all contributed to the decline in the size of the indigenous population.

Much of the decline resulted from disease: smallpox, measles, the bubonic plague, cholera, typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet fever, various forms of influenza and whooping cough, malaria, and yellow fever as well as some venereal diseases.  But colonial contact itself had a powerful impact.  Such factors as displacement and mass relocation, forced labor, warfare, and changes in the ecology not only sharply increased death rates but reduced birth rates.

How do we know?  After all, systemic censuses only appeared much later, with the first national census counts taking place in Sweden in 1749, the United States in 1790, and Britain and France in 1801. China did not conduct its first census until 1953.  

One source of information lies in the estimates made by explorers, missionaries, soldiers, and other observers about specific Indian tribes.  This was the method employed by James Mooney, a Smithsonian ethnologist.  Assuming that the observers exaggerated the size of the Indian population, he took their lowest estimates he could find. His tribe-by-tribe estimate, published in 1928, concluded that there were 1.15 million Indians north of Mexico in 1492.

Another approach is to estimate the population density that specific geographical areas could support.  This was how the anthropologist Alfred Kroeber arrived at his 1934 estimate that the Indian population north of the Rio Grande River was about 4.2 million in 1492.

More recently, scholars have tapped a wide variety of sources to reconstruct the size of the pre-contact Indian population. These include counts of the number of Indian warriors, baptismal and tax records, accounts of epidemics, acreage devoted to raising corn and beans to estimate food supply, and even the number of canoes.  The result was to sharply raise the estimated population.

The following table illustrates the range of population estimates.

The Environmental Consequences of the Columbian Exchange

The Columbian Exchange had profound consequences for the natural environment.  

Wildlife was extraordinarily abundant at the time of European contact.  Passenger pigeons darkened the skies.  Deer congregated by the hundreds.  A single net in Virginia caught 5,000 sturgeon.  Observers reported seeing crabs and oysters a foot in length, and lobsters as large as five or even six feet long.

The area north of Mexico was not unbroken forest.  East of the Mississippi, Indian peoples cleared fields with fire, resulting in an environment consisting of widely spaced trees and relatively few shrubs, providing room for deer, elk, porcupine, quail, rabbits, and turkeys.  The abundance of game also encouraged such predators as eagles, foxes, hawks, and wolves.

Many indigenous peoples east of the Mississippi River plowed and sowed crops including corn, potatoes, pumpkin, and squash. In the Southwest, the Anasazi devised a complex system of dikes and dams to water fields.

The arrival of Europeans changed the face of the land.  The newcomers introduced grasses, plants, and weeds including clover, dandelions, and ragweed.  The introduction of cattle, pigs, and sheep, too, reshaped the natural environment. There would also be a huge European demand for the furs of beaver, foxes, martens, muskrats, and otters, and later for buffalo hides, as well as for wood.

After 1492, the human ability to exploit the natural environment greatly increased.  Over time, many fur bearing animals would be hunted to near extinction.  Sea creatures, too, especially cod and whales, would be radically reduced in numbers.


Three Forms of European Expansion

European expansion into the Americas, Africa, and Asia took three forms:  Conquest, commerce, and colonial settlement.


Conquest

Conquest took place where there was a large indigenous population and Europeans succeeded in defeating a preexisting state apparatus and then ruled, directly or indirectly, in its place.  In the Americas, conquest took place in Mexico and Peru.  In Africa, it took place only in Angola.

How was it, one might ask, that 600 Spanish able to conquer the Aztec Empire in Mexico and just 110 foot soldiers and 67 cavalry able to conquer the Inca Empire in Peru?

At one time, the answer was said to lie in the Europeans’ overwhelming military superiority, with guns, horses, and steel weapons making the difference.  

In fact, European weaponry was not decisive.  Armored cavalry and projectile weapons were not especially effective in the New World. The Europeans were seriously outnumbered and their weapons were slow to fire.

Conquest succeeded not because of Spain’s military superiority but because the Spanish Conquistadors were able to play groups off against one another. In Mexico and Peru, the Spanish succeeded by forging military alliances with groups that had been subjugated by the Aztecs and Incas.  And Spain succeeded in governing its empire by working through their allies existing systems of government.  The Spanish recognized the indigenous rules and gave these “caciques” rights to land.

Europeans were also aided by disease, which demoralized and weakened the Indian population.
Commerce


Commerce

Commerce took place where the Europeans were unable to defeat the native population militarily, both because of the fighting prowess of the indigenous people or of the small number of Europeans willing to migrate.  

With the exception of Angola (conquered by Portugal in 1575) and a number of small islands off the coast of Africa and the Philippines (conquered by Spain in 1570), Europeans were unable to conquer any parts of Africa or Asia.  All the Europeans were able to do was establish trading centers to import spices, silk, and porcelain from East Asia and gold, ivory, and slaves from Africa.  

By the mid-16th century, Portugal had already established fifty trading posts.  England would concentrate on trade with India; the Dutch in Cape Town in what is now South Africa, Colombo in what is now Sri Lanka, and the southern Pacific, especially Java (or what is now Indonesia). To support trade, England and the Netherlands established government-supported trading companies.  The English East India Trading Company was established in 1600 and the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) in 1602.

In French Quebec, relatively few French were willing to migrate, probably fewer than 3,000.  Those who did engaged in trade with the Indians usually involving beaver furs.  Few French women migrated and a large mixed race population arose.

The following map shows European trading posts in Africa and Asia around 1700.




Colonial Settlement

Settler colonies arose where the indigenous peoples were not powerful enough to expel the invaders and not producing enough wealth to make it worthwhile to allow them to continue to rule.

The first colonies were in islands off the coast of Europe such as Madeira, the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands, and Sao Tome, which were all colonized before Columbus sailed to the New World.  These were followed by the Caribbean, coastal Brazil, and coastal North America, beginning with Spanish Florida and moving northward.

England was especially likely to form settler colonies in the Caribbean and North America.  In contrast to the Spanish and Portuguese, the English, for the most part, did not intermarry with Indians.  Instead, the English displaced the indigenous peoples and repopulated the area with English settlers and, over time, with enslaved Africans.  This process of displacement is known as “plantation settlement.”

Lacking conquered or enslaved Indians, the northern Europeans relied initially on indentured servants from their homelands.  These servants agreed to a contract to labor for a period of time with the promise that they could become landowners at the end of their term.  The term was 3 to 7 years in length.  Faced with growing difficulty in attracting indentured servants, the English increasingly relied upon enslaved Africans as a source of labor.


Differences Between Spanish, French, and English Colonization

One important difference in Spanish, French, and English colonizers was in their attitude toward the indigenous population.  The Spanish viewed the Indian population as a usable labor force, that could be used to mine for gold and silver, raise agricultural crops, and work in primitive factories.  The French, in Canada, regarded the Indians as trading partners and military allies.  The English, in general, had no interest in coexistence.  For Spain, the removal or extermination of the Indian population was not a feasible possibility, since despite the impact of disease, the Indian population remained very large.  But in the areas settled by the English along the Atlantic coast, the Indian population was more loosely spread out over large areas.

England’s first experience with colonization took place in Ireland, which carried farreaching implications for the treatment of Native Americans.  The English during the 15th and 16th centuries viewed the Irish as barbarians who were only nominally Christian.  The English sought to pursh the Irish out of desirable areas and replace them with English or Scots.

Another key difference lay in the number and sex ratio of the populations.  Not only would the English migrate in much greater numbers, but their sex ratio was much more even than among the Spanish or French.  A third difference was that while the Spain’s New World Empire, and to a lesser extent, the French, were centrally controlled, the English colonies, initially, were far more decentralized, with private groups or companies responsible for their founding.


Primary Sources

The Meaning of America
1 / "They have no iron or steel or weapons, nor are they capable of using them"

At the time of the first discoveries, Europeans tended to view the New World from one of two contrasting perspectives. Many saw America as an earthly paradise, a land of riches and abundance, where the native peoples led lives of simplicity and freedom similar to those enjoyed by Adam and Eve in the biblical Garden of Eden.
	
Other Europeans described America in a much more negative light: as a dangerous and forbidding wilderness, a place of cannibalism and human misery, where the population lacked Christian religion and the trappings of civilization. This latter view of America as a place of savagery, cannibalism, and death would grow more pronounced as the Indian population declined precipitously in numbers as a result of harsh labor and the ravages of disease and as the slave trade began transporting millions of Africans to the New World.

But it was the positive view of America as a land of liberty, liberation, and material wealth that remained dominant. America served as a screen on which Europeans projected their deepest fantasies of a land where people could escape inherited privilege, corruption, and tradition. The discovery of America seemed to mark a new beginning for humanity, a place where all Old World laws, customs, and doctrines were removed, and where scarcity gave way to abundance.

In a letter reporting his discoveries to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain, Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) paints a portrait of the indigenous Taino Indians as living lives of freedom and innocence near the Garden of Eden.

Christopher Columbus, Letter to the Sovereigns on His First Voyage, February 15-March 4 1493

	....The people of this island [Hispaniola] and of all the other islands which I have found and seen, or have not seen, all go naked, men and women, as their mothers bore them, except that some women cover one place with the leaf of a plant or with a net of cotton which they make for that purpose. They have no iron or steel or weapons, nor are they capable of using them, although they are well-built people of handsome stature, because they are wondrous timid. They have no other arms than the arms of canes, [cut] when they are in seed time, to the end of which they fix a sharp little stick; and they dare not make use of these, for oftentimes it has happened that I have sent ashore two or three men to some town to have speech, and people without number have come out to them, as soon as they saw them coming, they fled; even a father would not stay for his son; and this was not because wrong had been done to anyone; on the contrary, at every point where I have been and have been able to have speech, I have given them of all that I had, such as cloth and many other things, without receiving anything for it; but they are like that, timid beyond cure. It is true that after they have been reassured and have lost this fear, they are so artless and so free with all they possess, that no one would believe it without having seen it. Of anything they have, if you ask them for it, they never say no; rather they invite the person to share it, and show as much love as if they were giving their hearts; and whether the thing be of value or of small price, at once they are content with whatever little thing of whatever kind may be given to them. I forbade that they should be given things so worthless as pieces of broken crockery and broken glass, and lace points, although when they were able to get them, they thought they had the best jewel in the world.... And they know neither sect nor idolatry, with the exception that all believe that the source of all power and goodness is in the sky, and in this belief they everywhere received me, after they had overcome their fear. And this does not result from their being ignorant (for they are of a very keen intelligence and men who navigate all those seas, so that it is wondrous the good account they give of everything), but because they have never seen people clothed or ships like ours.


Utilizing the Native Labor Force
2 / "With fifty men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them"

Christopher Columbus's voyages of discovery were part of a much broader pattern of European commercial and financial expansion during the fifteenth century. In the span of less than four decades, European countries revolutionized sea travel. Led by tiny Portugal, fifteenth-century European mariners adapted from the Arabs a small sturdy ship known as the caravel capable of sailing against the wind. They also refined such navigational aids as the astrolabe and quadrants, allowing sailors to accurately chart their latitude, while mapmakers and geographers greatly improved the quality of maps. In just a decade, from 1488 to 1498, European sailors mastered the winds and currents of the south Atlantic, making it possible for the first time to sail from Western Europe to West Africa and into the Indian Ocean.

With financial support from German and Italian bankers and merchants, Portugal was able to exploit these discoveries and create a system of long-distance trade and commerce based on sugar and slavery. As early as 1420, the Portuguese began to settle islands off the West African coast. In Madeira, the Azores, the Canary Islands, and other islands, the Portuguese introduced sugar cane. Beginning in 1443, Portugal established a string of trading posts along the West African coast, which soon became major sources of slave labor for the Iberian Peninsula and especially for the Atlantic island sugar plantations.

Christopher Columbus was very familiar with this network of Atlantic trade. Born in Genoa in 1451, the son of an Italian wool weaver, Columbus was pushed by his father into trade. In 1476 he settled in a Genoese trading community in Portugal. There, he met his wife, whose father was the Portuguese governor of an island off Africa's Atlantic coast. For ten years Columbus lived in Madeira and made voyages to the Azores, the Canary Islands, and western Africa. Forty-one years old at the time he made his first voyage of discovery, Columbus was obsessed with the idea of finding a new route to the Far East, which would provide him with enough wealth to pay for the liberation of the Holy Land from Islamic rule. Personally familiar with slavery and sugar production when he arrived in the Caribbean, he quickly saw the opportunity to extract riches from this new land.

As the following extracts from his journal reveal, within days of his arrival in the New World Columbus regarded the Indian population as a potential labor source. As he and other Europeans would soon discover, the Indians, especially the Caribs, were not as timid or as easily dominated as Columbus originally thought.

Christopher Columbus, Journal

Sunday, 14th of October
	...these people are very simple as regards the use of arms, as your Highnesses will see from the seven that I caused to be taken, to bring home and learn our language and return; unless your Highnesses should order them all to be brought to Castile, or to be kept as captives on the same island; for with fifty men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them....

Sunday, 16th of December
	...your Highnesses may believe that this island (Hispaniola), and all the others, are as much yours as Castile. Here there is only wanting a settlement and the order to the people to do what is required. For I, with the force I have under me, which is not large, could march over all these islands without opposition. I have seen only three sailors land, without wishing to do harm, and a multitude of Indians fled before them. They have no arms, and are without warlike instincts; they all go naked, and are so timid that a thousand would not stand before three of our men. So that they are good to be ordered about, to work and sow, and do all that may be necessary, and to build towns, and they should be taught to go about clothed and to adopt our customs.

Question

Describe how Columbus characterizes the Taino Indians that he encountered in the Caribbean.  How do these people, in his view, differ from Europeans?   


New World Fantasies
3 / All slavery, and drudgery...is done by bondsmen"

The European voyages of discovery of the late fifteenth century played a critical role in the development of modern conceptions of progress. From the ancient Greeks onward, western culture tended to emphasize certain unchanging and universal ideas about human society. But the discovery of the New World threw many supposedly universal ideals into doubt. The Indians, who seemingly lived free from all the traditional constraints of civilized life--such as private property or family bonds--offered a vehicle for criticizing the corruptions, abuses, and restrictions of European society.

In 1516 the English humanist Sir Thomas More (1478-1535) published Utopia, his description of an ideal society where crime, injustice, and poverty did not exist. Writing just twenty-four years after Columbus's first voyage to the Caribbean, More located his perfect society in the Western Hemisphere. More's book, written in the form of a dialogue, contrasts the simplicity of life in Utopia with contemporary Europe's class divisions. In Utopia, property is held in common, gold is scorned, and all inhabitants eat the same food and wear the same clothes. And yet several features of More's Utopia strike a jarring note. For one thing, his book justifies taking land from the indigenous people because, in European eyes, they did not cultivate it. And further, the prosperity and well-being of More's ideal society ultimately rest on slave labor.

Sir Thomas More, Utopia, London 1516

	....When I consider with myself and weigh in my mind the wise and godly ordinances of the Utopians, among whom with very few laws all things be so well and wealthily ordered, that virtue is had in price and estimation, and yet, all things being there common, every man hath abundance of everything.
	....No household or farm in the country hath fewer than forty persons, men and women, besides two bondmen, which be all under the rule and order of the good man, and the good wife of the house, being both very sage and discreet persons.... For they dividing the day and the night into twenty-four hours, appoint and assign only six of those hours to work....
	In this hall all vile service, all slavery, and drudgery, with all laboursome toil and business, is done by bondmen....


Question

Writing just twenty-four years after Columbus's first voyage of discovery, Sir Thomas More presented his vision of an ideal society, set in the New World, in a book entitled Utopia. What is life like in More's Utopia? Who does the work in More's perfect society? 


Labor Needs
4 / "This is the best land in the world for Negroes"

Christopher Columbus believed that Indians would serve as a slave labor force for Europeans, especially on the sugar cane plantations off the western coast of north Africa. Convinced that the Taino Indians of the Caribbean would make ideal slaves, he transported 500 to Spain in 1495. Some 200 died during the overseas voyage. Thus Columbus initiated the African slave trade, which originally moved from the New World to the Old, rather than the reverse.

By the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain's experiments in enslaving Indians were failing. To meet the mounting demand for labor in mining and agriculture, the Spanish began to exploit a new labor force: slaves from western Africa. 

Slavery was a familiar institution to many sixteenth-century Europeans. Although slavery had gradually died out in northwestern Europe, it continued to flourish around the Mediterranean Sea. Ongoing warfare between Christianity and Islam produced thousands of slave laborers, who were put to work in heavy agriculture in Italy, southern France, eastern Spain, Sicily, and eastern Europe near the Black Sea. Most slaves in this area were "white"--either Arabs or natives of Russia and eastern Europe. But by the mid-fifteenth century, the expansion of the Ottoman empire cut off the supply of white slaves. It was during the mid-fifteenth century that Portugal established trading relations along the West African coast, and discovered that it was able to purchase huge numbers of black slaves at a low cost.

Several factors made African slaves the cheapest and most expedient labor source. The prevailing ocean currents made it relatively easy to transport Africans to the Caribbean. Further, because Africans came from developed agricultural societies, they were already familiar with highly organized tropical agriculture. The first African slaves were brought to the New World as early as 1502, where they would mine precious metals and raise sugar, coffee, and tobacco--the first goods sold to a mass consumer market.

The African slave trade would be an indispensable part of European settlement and development of the New World. By the mid-eighteenth century, slaves could be found everywhere in the Americas from French Canada to Chile. Indeed, the number of Africans forcibly imported into the New World actually exceeded the number of whites who would come to the Americas before the 1830s. Between 1492 and 1820, approximately ten to fifteen million Africans were forcibly brought to the New World, while only about two million Europeans had migrated. In this excerpt, Alonzo de Zuazo (1466-1527), the Spanish Judge of Hispaniola, argues that slavery is essential for Caribbean development.

Alonso de Zuazo, to Cardinal Ximenes, Regent of Spain, January 22, 1518

Indeed, there is urgent need for Negro slaves, as I have written to inform His Highness, and in as much as Your Lordship will see that part of my letter to His Highness, I shall not repeat it here, except to say that it is urgent to have them brought. Ships sail from these islands for Seville to purchase essential goods such as cloth of various colours as well as other merchandise, which is used as ransom of Cape Verde whither the goods are carried with the permission of the King of Portugal. By virtue of the said ransom, let ships go there and bring away as many male and female Negroes as possible, newly imported and between the ages of fifteen to eighteen or twenty years. They will be made to adopt our customs in this island and they will be settled in villages and married to their women folk. The burden of work of the Indians will be eased and unlimited amounts of gold will be mined. This is the best land in the world for Negroes, women and old men, and it is very rarely that one of these people die.

Why does Alonso de Zuazo urge Spain to send enslaved Africans to the New World?  

The Black Legend
5 / "Great atrocities are committed against the indigenous people"

Late in the eighteenth century, around the time of the three hundredth anniversary of Columbus's voyage of discovery, the Abbé Raynal (1713-1796), a French philosopher, offered a prize for the best answer to the question: "Has the discovery of America been beneficial or harmful to the human race?"

Eight responses to the question survive. Of these, four argued that Columbus's voyage had harmed human happiness. The European discovery of the New World had a devastating impact on the Indian peoples of the Americas. Oppressive labor, disruption of the Indian food supply, deliberate campaigns of extermination, and especially disease decimated the Indian population. Isolated from such diseases as smallpox, influenza, and measles, the indigenous population proved to be extraordinarily susceptible. Within a century of contact, the Indian population in the Caribbean and Mexico had shrunk by over 90 percent.

During the sixteenth century, when the House of Habsburg presided over an empire that included Spain, Austria, Italy, Holland, and much of the New World, Spain's enemies created an enduring set of ideas known as the "Black Legend." Propagandists from England, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands vilified the Spanish as a corrupt and cruel people who subjugated and exploited the New World Indians, stole their gold and silver, infected them with disease, and killed them in numbers without precedent. In 1580, William I, Prince of Orange (1533-1584), who led Dutch Protestants in rebellion against Spanish rule, declared that Spain "committed such horrible excesses that all the barbarities, cruelties and tyrannies ever perpetrated before are only games in comparison to what happened to the poor Indians."

Ironically, the Black Legend drew upon criticisms first voiced by the Spanish themselves. During the sixteenth century, observers like Bartolomé de las Casas (1474-1566), the bishop of Chiapas, condemned maltreatment of the Indians. As a way to protect Indians from utter destruction, las Casas proposed an alternative labor force: slaves from Africa. Given the drastic decline of the Indian population and the reluctance of Europeans to perform heavy agricultural labor, African slaves would raise the staple crops that provided the basis for New World prosperity: sugar, coffee, rice, and indigo.

Las Casas would come to regret his role in encouraging the slave trade. Although he rejected the idea that slavery itself was a crime or sin, he did begin to see African slavery as a source of evil. Unfortunately, las Casas's apology was not published for more than 300 years.

Bartolomé de las Casas, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (1542)

New Spain [Mexico] was discovered in 1517 and, at the time, great atrocities were committed against the indigenous people of the region and some were killed by members of the expedition. In 1518 the so-called Christians set about stealing from the people and murdering them on the pretence of settling the area. And from that year until this--and it is now 1542--the great iniquities and injustices, the outrageous acts of violence and the bloody tyranny of these Christians have steadily escalated, the perpetrators having lost all fear of God, all love of their sovereign, and all sense of self-respect. Even now, in September 1542, the atrocities get worse by the day, it being the case, as we have said, that the infernal brutality and utter inhumanity of the acts committed have readily increased as time has gone on.

Among other massacres was one which took place in Cholula, a great city of some thirty thousand inhabitants. When all the dignitaries of the city and the region came out to welcome the Spaniards with all due pomp and ceremony, the priests to the fore and the high priest at the head of the procession, and they proceeded to escort them into the city and lodge them in the houses of the lord and the leading citizens, the Spaniards decided that he moment had come to organize a massacre (or "punishment" as they themselves express such things) in order to inspire fear and terror in all the people of the territory. This was, indeed the pattern they followed in all the lands they invaded: to stage a bloody massacre of the most public possible kind in order to terrorize those meek and gentle peoples. What they did was the following. They requested the local lord to send for all the nobles and leading citizens of the city and of all the surrounding communities subject to it and, as soon as they arrived and entered the building to begin talks with the Spanish commander, they were seized without anyone outside getting wind of what was afoot. Part of the original request was they should bring with them five or six thousand native bearers and these were mustered in the courtyards when and as they arrived. One could not watch these poor wretches getting ready to carry the Spaniards' packs without taking pity on them, stark naked as they were with only their modesty hidden from view, each with a kind of little net on his shoulders in which he carried his own modest store of provisions. They all got down on their haunches and waited patiently like sheep. Once they were all safely inside the courtyard, together with a number of others who were also there at the time, armed guards took up positions covering the exits and Spanish soldiers unsheathed their swords and grasped their lances and proceeded to slaughter these poor innocents. Not a single soul escaped.

From Cholula they made their way to Mexico City. On their journey, they were showered with thousands of gifts from the great king Montezuma who also sent some of his men to stage entertainments and banquets for them on the way. When they reached the Great Causeway which runs for some two leagues right up to the city itself, they were greeted by Montezuma's own brother and many local dignitaries bearing valuable gifts of gold, silver and apparel from the great lord.

Yet that same day, or so I am reliably informed by a number of eye-witnesses, the Spaniards seized the great king unawares by means of a trick and held him under armed guard of eighty soldiers, eventually putting him in irons.
	
....The pretext upon which the Spanish invaded each of these provinces and proceeded to massacre the people and destroy their lands--lands which teemed with people and should surely have been a joy and a delight to any true Christian--was purely and simply that they were making good the claim of the Spanish Crown to the territories in question. At no stage had any order been issued entitling them to massacre the people or to enslave them. Yet, whenever the natives did not drop everything and rush to recognize publicly the truth of the irrational and illogical claims that were made, and whenever they did not immediately place themselves completely at the mercy of the iniquitous and cruel and bestial individuals who were making such claims, they were dubbed outlaws and held to be in rebellion against His Majesty. 


Question

Bartolomé de las Casas delivered sermons and wrote books denouncing Spanish cruelty toward the Indians, and established Venezuela as a society people of different races might live together in peace. According to las Casas, how did the Conquistadors treat the Indians? What does it say about the Spanish that they allowed las Casas to openly denounce cruel treatment of Indians?



A Critique of the Slave Trade
6 / "A thousand acts of robbery and violence are committed in the course of bartering and carrying off Negroes"

Las Casas was not alone in recognizing the evils of slavery. In this selection, another Spanish cleric, Fray Tomas Mercado (d. 1575?), argues that the slave trade was the product of deception, robbery, and violence.

The European colonization of the New World brought three disparate geographical areas together: the Americas, western Europe, and western Africa. Some of the consequences of this inter-cultural contact are well-known, such as the introduction of horses, pigs, and cattle into the New World, and the transfer of potatoes, beans, and tomatoes to Europe. But other consequences of the Columbian exchange are less noted. As a result of the Atlantic slave trade, such New World food crops as cassava, sweet potatoes, squash, and peanuts were carried to Africa, sharply stimulating African population growth and therefore increasing the population in ways that helped make the slave trade possible.

Fray Tomas de Mercado, Suma de Tratos y Contratos, Seville, 1587

It is public opinion and knowledge that no end of deception is practiced and a thousand acts of robbery and violence are committed in the course of bartering and carrying off Negroes from their country and bringing them to the Indies and to Spain.... Since the Portuguese and Spaniards pay so much for a Negro, they go out to hunt one another without the pretext of a war, as if they were deer; even the very Ethiopians, who are different, being induced to do so by the profit derived. They make war on one another, their gain being the capture of their own people, and they go after one another in the forests where they usually hunt.... In this way, and contrary to all justice, a very great number of prisoners are taken. And no one is horrified that these people are ill-treating and selling one another, because they are considered uncivilized and savage. In addition to the pretext, of parents selling their children as a last resort, there is the bestial practice of selling them without any necessity to do so, and very often through anger or passion, for some displeasure or disrespect they have shown them.... The wretched children are taken to the market place for sale, and as the traffic in Negroes is so great, there are Portuguese, or even Negroes themselves, ready everywhere to buy them. There are also among them traders in this bestial and brutal business, who set boundaries in the interior for the natives and carry them off for sale at a higher price on the coasts or in the islands. I have seen many acquired in this way. Apart from these acts of injustice and robberies committed among themselves, there are thousands of other forms of deception practiced in those parts by the Spaniards to trick and carry off the Negroes finally as newly imported slaves, which they are in fact, to the ports, with a few bonnets, gewgaws, beads and bits of paper under which they give them. They put them aboard the ships under false pretenses, hoist anchor, set sail, and make off towards the high seas with their booty.... I know a man who recently sailed to one of those Islands and, with less than four thousand ducats for ransom, carried off four hundred Negroes without license or registration.... They embark four and five hundred of them in a boat which, sometimes, is not a cargo boat. The very stench is enough to kill most of them, and, indeed, very many die. The wonder is that twenty percent of them are not lost.

Question

On what grounds does Fray Tomas de Mercado condemn slavery? 

Debating the Issues

1.  In the late eighteenth century, a French philosopher, Abbé Raynal offered a prize for the best answer to the question: "Has the discovery of American been beneficial or harmful to the human race?"  How would you answer this question?

2.  Christopher Columbus has been hailed as a great discoverer who brought European culture to a previously unknown world and condemned as a man who brought devastating diseases to unprotected people and initiated the Atlantic slave trade. How would you evaluate Columbus and his legacy?

3.  Why did European colonizers introduce slavery in their New World possessions?

4.  Following the discovery of the New World, new ways of thinking--built around the concepts of progress and human perfectibility--became more common in Europe. Writers like Thomas More envisioned ideal perfection in laws, government, and social conditions and advocated various schemes for social improvement. Why did the discovery of the New World give rise to utopian thinking?

5.  What farreaching changes did Columbus's voyages of discovery bring to the Americas?


What if?

How might American history have been different: 

If Indians had greater resistance to Old World diseases?

If ocean currents had not favored shipping from Africa toward Brazil and the Caribbean?


Making Ethical Judgments

How should we regard Bartolomé de las Casas--as a outspoken defender of Indians against harsh Spanish policies or as a man who helped open the way to slavery?
