		<p class="content-inject">Historical reputations rise and fall, and Columbus’s is no exception. Over time, he has been revered, reviled, and even ignored.</p><p class="content-inject">During his own lifetime, his reputation had ups and downs. Indeed, in 1500, he and his brothers were sent to Spain in chains, accused of brutality toward the native peoples and to the Spanish colonists.</p><p class="content-inject">It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that Columbus, soon after the American revolution, that began to be celebrated as a brave, skillful, and visionary explorer. The first Columbus Day celebration recorded in the United States took place in New York on October 12th, 1792.</p><p class="content-inject">The 400th anniversary of his epic voyage was marked by the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which attracted over a quarter of the U.S. population. But it was not until 1937 that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed October 12th to be Columbus Day, a national holiday.</p><p class="content-inject">The 500th anniversary of the voyage of discovery generated intense controversy, with Columbus condemned by some as a genocidal exploiter of New World peoples, an initiator of the Atlantic slave trade, and a despoiler of the natural environment.</p><p class="content-inject">So how might we best evaluate Columbus’s legacy, weighing his strengths, achievements, and flaws? One window is offered by art.</p><p class="content-inject">Compare and contrast these two depictions of Spanish colonialism, one by the American painter John Vanderlyn (1775-1852) and the other by the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.  Both, notably, appear in key national buildings: The U.S. Capitol and Mexico’s National Palace.  What do these paintings say about popular attitudes toward Columbus in their respective countries?</p>
