<!--
The 'name' variable is defined in the 'module' directive in app.js.
It's OK to hardcode everything into the HTML for now, but here's an example
of how you'd include a variable if you need to for some reason.
-->
<div>
Here's a module! {{name}}
</div>

<!-- The 'module' tag contains 'activity' tags, and we want their output
to be placed here.  The ng-transclude tag does that. -->
<ng-transclude></ng-transclude>
